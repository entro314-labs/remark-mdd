# Changelog

All notable changes to @markdownkit/remark-mdd.

## [Unreleased]

## [3.0.0] - 2026-09-08

### Added

- **`@table-N` / `@figure-N` references resolve.** Tables and images receive `table-N` / `figure-N` ids in document order, and the validator checks those references against the same numbering.
- **`DIRECTIVE_NOT_BLOCK_START` validation error.** A directive opener (`::header`, `::page-break ::`, …) must start a new Markdown block: the line above it has to be blank, a heading, a rule, or a fence delimiter. Otherwise the renderer sees the opener as paragraph text, so the validator now rejects what the renderer cannot render.
- **`{{page}}` in HTML.** In `::header`/`::footer`, `{{page}}` renders as `<span class="page-number">1</span>` instead of the literal token; paged outputs (PDF, DOCX) keep replacing it with a live field.

### Fixed

- **Derived paragraph classes no longer overwrite explicit ones.** `long-paragraph`, `legal-clause` and `numbered-item` are appended to an author's `{.class}` annotation instead of replacing it.
- **Directive end marker must be on its own line.** The renderer closed a directive on any paragraph ending in `::` while the validator only accepts a lone `::` line; both now agree.
- Type declarations (`types/mdd.d.ts`) match the runtime: `validateDocument` option names (`validateFrontmatterFlag`, …), `ValidationResult` fields, and directive container nodes; stale LaTeX-marker and unimplemented plugin-option types removed.

### Removed

- `./plugin-validator`: an unused second copy of the semantic-class list and nesting rules that had drifted from the JSON Schema; `./validator` is the single rule implementation.
- `remark-mdx-conditional` (and the optional `remark-mdx` peer dependency). It invoked `remark-mdx` as a transformer, which cannot work (remark-mdx is a parser extension and must be attached before parsing); per-file MDX selection lives in markdownkit's processor factory.

## [2.2.3] - 2026-06-18

### Fixed

- **`./validator` is now browser/bundler-safe.** It loaded its JSON Schema via
  `fs.readFileSync(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url) + …)`, which threw on import/use in a browser or a
  Vite/esbuild renderer (no `node:fs`/`node:path`/`node:url`). The two schemas are now `import`ed
  statically (`with { type: 'json' }`, Node ≥24), so the validator has no `node:*` runtime dependency
  and runs identically in Node and the browser. Validation behaviour and the schema files shipped in
  the package are unchanged.

### Migration

If you were using `@markdownkit/mdd` for plugins only:

**Before:**

```javascript
import { remarkMddDocumentStructure } from "@markdownkit/mdd";
// or
import remarkMddDocumentStructure from "@markdownkit/mdd/plugins/remark-mdd-document-structure.js";
```

**After:**

```javascript
import { remarkMddDocumentStructure } from "@markdownkit/remark-mdd";
// or
import remarkMddDocumentStructure from "@markdownkit/remark-mdd/plugins/document-structure";
```

### Breaking Changes

None - this is a new package extracted from the main MDD package.
